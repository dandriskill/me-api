# Me API
This little app was built for REDX.

## Setup on Local (DEVELOPMENT)
Ensure you have a local installation of MongoDB under your computer's User folder.

Run `/Users/{USER}/mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath=/Users/ddriskill/mongodb-data` to start database.

Open a new terminal tab and navigate to the root of `me` and run `npm start` to start the API server, which will be available on port 3001.

Open a new terminal tab and navigate to `me/src/me-react` and run `npm start` to start the frontend app, which will be available on port 3000.

Sign up, logout, login, and edit your profile as desired. :)
